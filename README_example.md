# Wonderful World of Wines Marketing Optimization

**Problem type:** Datamining - Clustering Customers For Marketing Insides

## Problem Description

A wine seller based in the USA has provided an active database of 10.000 customers. 
A Portuguese banking institution made several marketing campaigns to sell its 
customers a term deposit (*). The marketing campaigns were based on phone 
calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in 
order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not 
('no') subscribed.

Using the data collected from the campaigns, the bank wants to understand 
better its customers so that it can create products suitable for the 
different type of customers and improve its marketing campaigns conversion.
