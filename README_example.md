# BC0: Business Case example

**Problem type:** Prediction of service subscription

**Submission date:** no submission

## Problem Description

A Portuguese banking institution made several marketing campaigns to sell its 
customers a term deposit (*). The marketing campaigns were based on phone 
calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in 
order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not 
('no') subscribed.

Using the data collected from the campaigns, the bank wants to understand 
better its customers so that it can create products suitable for the 
different type of customers and improve its marketing campaigns conversion.
